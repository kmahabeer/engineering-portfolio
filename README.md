Welcome to my engineering portfolio! This repository contains the source code for the frontend of my engineering portfolio website, where I showcase my personal projects and explore various topics related to my field.

## Motivation

In the past, I experimented with several website builders to showcase my work. While they offered convenience, I felt limited in terms of customization and aesthetics. To overcome these boundaries, have full control over my portfolio, and to take on a challenge, I decided to build it as close to scratch as possible.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio is built using TypeScript, JavaScript, [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I believe in good software engineering practices and version control. Therefore, I used Git to manage the project and its development. 

## Get in Touch

I highly appreciate and welcome constructive feedback. If you have suggestions, feel free to submit an issue to this repository. Or if you simply want to connect, you can reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kevinmahabeer/).

Thank you for visiting my engineering portfolio! I hope you find it insightful and engaging.
